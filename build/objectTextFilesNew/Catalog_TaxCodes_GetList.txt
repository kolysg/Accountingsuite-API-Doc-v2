"Description": "Tangible Personal Property (TPP)",
"AdditionalInformation": "Tangible personal property is generally deemed to be items, other than real property (i.e. land and buildings etc.), that are tangible in nature. The presumption of taxability is on all items of TPP unless specifically made non-taxable by individual state and/or local statutes. This system tax code can be used when no other specific system tax code is applicable or available. Additionally, this system tax code has a taxable default associated with it and consequently the user could use this code for any and all products that are known to be taxable and if they want to limit the number of system tax codes being used."
